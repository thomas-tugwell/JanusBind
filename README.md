# Installation:

JanusBind was built with Python 3.11 and requires PyRosetta, therefore it is recommended you compile [this](https://graylab.jhu.edu/download/PyRosetta4/archive/release/PyRosetta4.Debug.python311.linux/PyRosetta4.Debug.python311.linux.release-387.tar.bz2) version of PyRosetta from source. Testing was not performed on any other versions.

JanusBind uses the LigandMPNN repo for binder sequence generation and pre-packing. Clone the repo into the main directory of JanusBind with
```git clone https://github.com/dauparas/LigandMPNN.git```
