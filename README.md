# Installation:

JanusBind was built with Python 3.11 and requires PyRosetta, therefore it is recommended you compile [this](https://graylab.jhu.edu/download/PyRosetta4/archive/release/PyRosetta4.Debug.python311.linux/PyRosetta4.Debug.python311.linux.release-387.tar.bz2) version of PyRosetta from source. Testing was not performed on any other versions.

JanusBind uses the LigandMPNN repo for binder sequence generation. Clone the repo into the main directory of JanusBind:
```
git clone https://github.com/dauparas/LigandMPNN.git
```
